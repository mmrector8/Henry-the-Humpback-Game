# Henry-the-Humpback-Game

## Background:

Henry the Humpback is a game about Humpback Whales in Monterey Bay. As a player, you will be a juvenile humpback whale named Henry, and learn about Humpback Whales along the way! Your goal help Henry navigate his surroundings and eat 3000 lbs of krill to prepare for his migration south. You need to avoid obstacles, you will lose health points if you hit them. Eat 3000 lbs of krill before you run out of health points.

As the game progresses and Henry eats, he will grow in size, thus making it more difficult for him to navigate his surroundings. 


**Here are the general rules:**
***
* You will control Henry using your keyboard. 
* Use the left arrow to move horizontally, the up arrow to move vertically, and the down arrow to move down the water column.
* You need to eat 3,000 lbs of krill. Humpbacks can eat up to 3,000 lbs of food a day and feed throughout the summer and fall in Monterey!
* Make sure you avoid any trash- Humpbacks like to eat krill, not plastic!
* Avoid ships and other obstacles as well!
* If you run into obstacles you will lose health points. If you hit 0 health points, you lose the game!
